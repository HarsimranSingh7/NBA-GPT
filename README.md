# NBA GPT

NBA GPT is a RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) chatbot built with JavaScript, LangChain.js, Next.js, Vercel, and OpenAI. This chatbot is trained on NBA-related data, providing real-time, contextually relevant answers to NBA questions by augmenting OpenAI's language model with custom data on the NBA. This project allows NBA fans to get up-to-date answers about players, stats, history, and much more.

## üèÄ Features

- Retrieves and scrapes NBA-related data from the internet to keep responses updated.
- Integrates with OpenAI's language model to produce human-like, accurate responses.
- Uses vector embeddings for similarity matching, powered by DataStax's vector database.
- Displays suggested prompts or allows users to ask their own questions.
- Includes a live database of recent NBA information to ensure context accuracy beyond standard LLM cut-off dates.

## üåê Deployment

This project is ready to deploy on Vercel. Ensure that your environment variables are configured on Vercel under the "Environment Variables" section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

NBA GPT provides an interactive chat interface with suggested prompts. You can:
- Choose a suggested question about the NBA.
- Type a custom question to get real-time information.
- Rely on the chatbot‚Äôs dynamic responses, which pull data from recent NBA sources.

### Example Questions

- "Who is the top scorer of the 2024 season?"
- "What is the latest trade rumor involving LeBron James?"
- "Who won the most recent NBA championship?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI API credits.
- **Database Scraping**: The `seed` command will fetch and store NBA data in your DataStax database. Adjust this script if you want additional data sources.
